# Solve Every Light

When enabled, the plugin performs a plate solve for each light frame (and optionally for snapshots) at runtime.
If the plate solving is successful, the astrometric solution is written into the image header.
This is particularly useful for applications such as variable star observations and their processing, each frame to have an astrometric solution stored.
